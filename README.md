## Structure


## Pipeline
We start off development by coding tests based on the backlog of our current sprint. When a test passes the group then goes on to code the actual functions that makes up the application. Once the new code is considered functional and complete the code will then be pushed to a separate branch. A pull request is then made waiting on a review and/or approval from another group member. Once a pull request is review and approved the merge to main is usually done by the member that created the pull request as they are able to verify the expected results.

Once the merge request is realized the code then finds its way to the main branch. It is only when the group is 100% satisfied with the new code that it is deployed to the server. We've usually only deployed larger chunks of code that make up important functions that has gone through our checking process instead of deploying several, smaller parts of code as to minimize the risk of errors and/or mistakes.
